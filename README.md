# XRBase
Basic XR Toolset for Unity

Features
- Two-handed weapons
- Magazines + slide reloading
- Leaning over stuff while not destroying movement

Installation
- Start a new Unity project (I use URP)
- Edit > Project Settings > XR Plugin Management > Install
- Check the boxes for the headsets you want to use (SteamVR instructions TBD)
- Install the XR Interaction Toolkit from the Package Manager (you might need to enable preview packages under "Advanced")
- Install [Quick Outline](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/quick-outline-115488) from the Unity Asset store
- Clone this repo into the /Assets/ folder, so you end up with /Assets/XRBase/
- Drag the Player/Player prefab and the Outjects/Weapons/SMG prefabs into your scene
- Be mad about Unity collision layers and how I haven't figured them out yet (I need to add a sample scene).
